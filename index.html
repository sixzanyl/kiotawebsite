              <H2>The Founder</H2>
              <p>Consolata Keli saw the need of starting kiota(kiota simply meaning shelter “home”)for women and girls who are abused physically, emotionally and psychologically.
                Consolata is a teacher by profession and has worked with the community for soo long hence understands the challenges the community is going through. She later left her teaching career and joined a Christian org that works for the community and cares for expectant mums, youth and young girls.
                Consolata felt the call to start kiota in mtwapa area as she feels the burden to start almost a similar thing in her area, she is the programs coordinator of this org and she plans, teaches and runs all the programs at the center.
                The urge to start Kiota around her community in mtwapa was pushed by the lives she sees every day in her people’s lives, Kiota will provide a safe space for women, young girls and the community at large.

        <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Kiota dream was born to life after the founder and cofounder reconnected after many years. They sat and talked on the need of starting it.They talked and shared a lot and being friends for many years, the co-founder, Francis Shisoka suggested that there was need to start kiota to be of help to other mums and girls and create awareness and help them not to go through what her friend  went through.
              Consolata was born and raised in Kenyan coast and she grew with her parents and her older brother. She started school with lots of challenges and her dad was an addidict.She grew up seeing her mum being beaten, chased out of the house. Her mum was abused physically, emotionally and psychologically which led to one day, her mum woke up and left .she said enough was enough, She ended up staying with her toxic dad and her brother who was doing hard drugs at that time, She mentions she can’t remember how many times she saw her mum being abused, they were thrown out of their rental house many times as her parents couldn’t afford the rent. It was hard for a young girl.
              After few years her mum passed on after a short illness while staying with a relative. Things got worse as now she had to struggle even getting money from her dad to get just a pack of sanitary pads was a challenge as her dad was not having a job, she resulted to using pieces of clothes every month as her dad was now worsening after he had buried his wife. More frustrations and stress led her dad to be drinking day and night. Consolata will have to care for him, cooking,(which food was a rare commodity),clean his mess when he comes home drunk and she had to take care of herself as no one cared, She took up the responsibilities of a family leader at an early age as well as she had to take care of herself.

              <p> A lady friend who happened to be a family friend from church witnessed all this and one day she asked Consolatas dad if she can take her in, thank God he agreed and that’s how she managed to finish her school. She loved and cared for her as her own, ensured she never lacked and offered counselling to her.   A lot has happened after that, and with all these challenges, she knew  and understood the need to care for abused women and young girls with that  in her heart and one day she knew that a dream and desire for them will one day come  to pass, Here we are now, a dream and prayer that has been in her heart for so many years is coming to pass, She believes with your support and prayer we will all be witnesses of what unity can bring. All a person needs is a safe place, peace and to be listened to, to be told and made aware of their worth and what the person can do in time of such challenges. Supporting  girls from broken homes, with education, care, shelter, security, guidance and counselling and love on them.
                She hoped and prayed for a place where she could sleep peacefully, away from noises, arguments, fights, not taking up the “ mother responsilities” that early, the shame of being thrown out to the streets at night coz her parents couldn’t afford the rent,all she wished for for was peace and to be told ,it shall be well.
                As you are all reading this, you are all wondering what about the boy child? Kiota will sit on an  area where most boys)men are addicted to drugs, alcohol and Kat chewing  which we are really hoping that kiota community will reach to, we are praying and hoping that more programs will be born as we start.
                It is our hope that this challenges that she went through and her life experiences has brought you and made you understand the burden she has for the community at large, She is soo optimistic and she understands that our upbringing does not determine our lives as grownups, we can make good choices if given guidance and support by people and the community at large, what does this mean? Our founder is a happy woman now, married by an amazing husband and blessed with two children. Nothing is permanent.</p>
